## Hey 👋, this is Berke Can Kandemir.

I'm a passionate software developer living in Izmir, Turkey, working for Garanti BBVA Technology. I love being part of development of web and mobile technologies. I love open source development and I build things on my GitHub profile (here). I love JavaScript, Swift, Python and Java.
